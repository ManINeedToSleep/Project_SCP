SCP Website Fun

Just a Fun Little Project! ðŸŽ¬ðŸ‘¾

So, I watched a few videos about SCP (Secure, Contain, Protect) and got inspired. Decided to dive into a little project to bring some of that eerie, mysterious vibe to life. This repo is where Iâ€™m playing around with some SCP-themed ideas and experiments.

Once you enter the website, you would be shwon a green, old, military esque monitor screen. If you do not care for the lore, you can just go click the button like normal. Then, you should be in the next window, whic hgives you level 1 access to the database. You unlock a singular file of SCP 096, one of ht emore popular creatures from the fanbase. You could dropdown the notes, if you want to check it.
