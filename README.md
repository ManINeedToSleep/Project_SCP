# Project_SCP: An Interactive Experience

Welcome to **Project_SCP**! ðŸŽ¬ðŸ‘¾

Inspired by the eerie and mysterious world of SCP (Secure, Contain, Protect), I decided to create an engaging web experience that brings the unsettling vibe of the SCP universe to life. This repository is where Iâ€™m experimenting with various SCP-themed concepts.

**Website Overview:**
When you enter the site, you'll be greeted by a green, vintage military-style monitor screen that sets the tone. If youâ€™re not interested in the lore, feel free to click the button to proceed. 

### Features:
1. **Level 1 Access:**
   - Once you click through, you'll gain Level 1 access to the SCP database.
   - You will unlock a detailed file on **SCP-096**, one of the most well-known entities in the SCP community.

2. **Interactive Elements:**
   - Explore SCP-096â€™s file with expandable notes that delve into its background, containment procedures, and incidents.
   - For those who want to dive deeper, the page includes links to popular YouTube documentaries featuring SCP-096.

3. **Atmospheric Design:**
   - The interface is designed to evoke the unsettling atmosphere of SCP lore, complete with retro graphics and haunting sound effects.

4. **Additional Content:**
   - As you progress, you may unlock additional SCP files and multimedia content that enrich your understanding of the SCP universe.

Feel free to explore, learn, and enjoy the eerie world of SCP!
